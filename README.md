# Voice-to-Pacenotes
Create pacenotes for RBR with voice commands.

Please see the [PDF](https://github.com/Wrench36/Voice-to-Pacenotes/blob/main/VTP%20Doc.pdf) at  for more information.

The Short version:<br>
Voice to pacenotes is a python script that uses your RBR pacenotes plugin install to determine the internal IDs of pacenotes, and then uses that information to write valid pacenote files using google speech recognition.
Have a look at the PDF file so I don't have to copy and reformat it here.
